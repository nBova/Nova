Application Boot-up/Frontend Research

Pegasus Frontend (https://pegasus-frontend.org/)
  - Similar idea, consolidates game emulators and actual game launchers (like Steam, GOG) into one interface and allows games to be launched directly from there
  - Allows shutting down and rebooting host PC directly from app
  - Apparently lots of customization for the UI. Themes, menus, animations, custom shader code
  - Written in C++

Hyperspin
  - Frontend for emulator consolidation



Further research required for Windows kiosk mode (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/kiosk-single-app)
